# Swear Todo

This is a learning project designed for me to experience handling memory management manually in C.
It is a simple, ncurses-based todo application.

"Swear Todo", because you swear you will complete the task -- and based on _ncurses_.

This is not an example of how you _should_ do memory management -- this is where I am learning,
and making mistakes, and hopefully correcting them over time.

In the `sqlite` branch, the application uses a SQLite database as the storage backend.
